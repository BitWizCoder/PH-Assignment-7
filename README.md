## Here are three project features:
1. Users can add their desired courses.
2. They can view course information, including price and course credit.
3. They can see all their selected course information in the sidebar.

## how I managed the state:
I used the `useState()` hook to handle the state. I included initial values where necessary and left it empty when no initial value was required.
